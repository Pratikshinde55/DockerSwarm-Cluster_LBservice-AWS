# Docker Swarm Cluster on AWS Cloud

Swarm is Docker tool used to create Cluster, Docker Swarm is built into the Docker Engine.           

What is Docker swarm cluster:

Cluster means having one or more Master Node and one or more worker node. The master node manage all worker/slave nodes.

## Creating four nodes Swarm cluster
 
For this Docker cluster, I take four AWS EC2 Insatnce one of these Instane make Master-Node & remaining nodes make Worker-Node.

### Prerequisite:
 
 1.AWS account & EC2 Instance 

 2.In all four Instances install Docker and start service

Install Docker command:

    yum install docker -y

Start Docker services command:

    systemctl start docker

Check Docker info command:

    docker info 

## Step: 1  [docker swarm create command ]

Make one node Master-Node,the node which want to make Master that node Ip address is required in my case i want make master node IP of that instance 172.31.37.180 .

- Note: To check IP use "ifconfig" command, use eth0 IP to make Swarm cluster that is Linux public IP.
   
Docker swarm init command is used to create cluster:

    docker swarm init  --advertise-addr 172.31.37.180

Here get one Token that paste in remaining Instance that want to be make Worker-Node.

## Step: 2 [Join Worker-Node to Master]

Paste token in three Worker-Node Instances (Docker must be installed & service start):

## Step: 3
 
Here Docker Swarm Cluster is created to check use "docker info" on the Master-Node Docker swarm. 

    docker node ls

### Why use Docker swarm:

Docker Swarm master node keep watching on Container or Task,if any Container goes down for any reason or Fault occurs, Master-Node auto-matically create same task on any Node.This is known a "fault tolerance".
   
- Load balancer & Scaling on Docker Swarm:-

### Replication:

Swarm cluster give capability to make exact copy of task in another node this concept is called as Replication.

### Load Balancer:

Docker swarm give pre-created set-up of load balancer, In Docker Swarm 'Load balancer' term is "Service".

"Load Balancer=Service"
        
Docker service(Load Balancer) is by default isolated,It can't connect outside world it only connect to Cluster nodes, But if we want to make connection to outside world, we use "--publish", patting, expose.

### Scaling :

There are two types of Scaling Vertical scaling and Horizontal scaling,We use Horizontal scaling.

Adding more containers or instance are called as 'Scale-out'& removing Containers or instances is called 'scale-in'.

To start any service in cluster we use 'Master node', The master node tracks the status of tasks & monitors the health of the cluster.

## Steps - [Docker swarm service LoadBalancer]

On Swarm Master node to start service Load balancer:

    docker service create --name myweb55 --publish 8080:80 vimal13/apache-webserver-php

Check service ls commnad:

    docker service ls 

Check where Task lauch command:
 
    docker service ps myweb55 

For scale-out use command:

    docker service scale myweb55=5

For scale-in use command:

     docker service scale myweb55=1

## Check on Google/Browser

Public IP of master instance + port no.(http://13.201.15.80:8080/)
